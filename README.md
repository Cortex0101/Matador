## Usage

### Brief overview of the game

The game's purpose is to buy, rent or sell properties to become the richest and potentially only matador (English: monopoly).

Each player starts on "Start" and moves their car around the board according to dice rolls. When a player lands on a property that another player does not already own, he can purchase it to collect rent when other players land on it. Alternatively, the bank auctions the property to the highest bidder. 

Rent significantly increases by building houses and hotels on properties. To quickly make money, players may mortgage their properties for half their value.
